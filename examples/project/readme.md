# Project Example

**DISCLAIMER:**

This is just a proof-of-concept that creates a random assortment of code and places it in random directories.

Although the generated code is syntactically correct, it may not be semantically valid.

This code generation is functional, but not optimal. You're welcome to make improvements if desired.

## Usage

All you need to do is run the `gen.php` script.

```bash
$ php gen.php
```

A `src` folder will be created with the code.

After that, you can execute the parser:

```bash
cargo run --example parser --release
```
